**Simply Mybatis**

**Introduction**
This is a mini-version of Mybatis which brings most core features of a real Mybatis .
It is a study demo, but it also imported design patterns and concepts shown in the original Mybatis.

**Background**
As a developer who wants to gain insight into design patterns and OOP rules, I decided to implement a Mybatis framework widely used in J2EE applications. The basic structure and workflow come from Mybatis3 and I also draw lessons from an open-source project in which only partial functions are achieved. To make the project functional and meet the minimum requirements of CRUD, some codes were added and modifications were conducted.

**key features**

- implement the binding between the interface and the XML file
- implement the non-primitive type parameter processing
- implement the wrapper of the original transaction
- implement the processing of resultset
- implement the basic CRUD operations

**Usage**

- [ ] To achieve CRUD demonstration, you can follow below steps
    
 
1. download the code
    
2.  create a table named account in a database named test in MySql
    

Note:
Three columns must be defined if you just want to take advantage of this demo without any code work

 open project in your device and step into TestClass where unit test methods have been created

3.  invoke test methods in order
    
* * *
- [ ] To use this framework in java applications, you want to do the following four steps
    

1.  get the sqlsessionfactory instance
    
    **SqlSessionFactory factory = new SqlSessionFactoryBuilder().build("conf.properties");**
    **Ps**:conf.properties is a property file containing database connection info and your mapper.xml location
    
2.  get the session instance
    **SqlSession session = factory.openSession();**
    
3.  get the proxy instance of your interface
    **AccountMapper mapper = session.getMapper(AccountMapper.class);**
    
4.  invoke methods defined in the interface
    **mapper.updateAccount(new Account(1,"mike",300.00));**


* * *

- [ ] If you want to implement a transaction, you may need to practice some changes based on the previous 4-steps

1.  get the sqlsessionfactory instance(same as previous)
    
2.  get the session instance with setting transaction on
    **SqlSession session = factory.openSession(true);**
    
3.  get the proxy instance of your interface(same as previous)
    
4.  wrap codes with try-catch-finnally and pratice manual commit,rollback and close
    **try{
    mapper.updateAccount(new Account(1,"mike",100.00));
    mapper.updateAccount(new Account(1,"mike",99.99));
    session.commit();
    }
    catch (Exception e){
    session.rollback();
    }finally {
    session.close();
    }**
